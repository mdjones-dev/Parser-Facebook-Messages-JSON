# Parser-Facebook-Messages-JSON
Used on the Facebook archive download (JSON). 

This script parses the .json files for private messages located in the messages/inbox. 
The output provides 3 text files for Generic, Call, and Share messages. 
The initial inspiration for this project was to collate a clean Call log.
